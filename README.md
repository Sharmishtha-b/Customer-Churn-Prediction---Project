# Customer-Churn-Prediction---Project

Churn prediction is a powerful tool for businesses to proactively address customer attrition. Churn rates serve as a metric for customer satisfaction, with low rates indicating content customers and high rates suggesting dissatisfaction and potential revenue loss. Churn can result from various factors such as bad customer service, financial issues, changing customer needs, dissatisfaction, perceived lack of value, customer switch to competitors, and lack of appreciation for long-time customers. Predicting churn enables proactive marketing campaigns targeting at-risk customers. Machine learning and data analysis play a crucial role in identifying, predicting, and addressing churn. 

<h3>Dataset</h3> 
The Telco Customer Churn dataset, originating from the IBM Developer Platform, provides a snapshot of a fictional telecommunications company's customer base. With records for 7,043 clients and 20 features, it serves as a valuable resource for exploring customer churn dynamics. The dataset encompasses demographic details, services subscribed to, and customer account information, including crucial factors like contract terms, billing preferences, and payment methods. The primary objective is to predict customer churn, a common challenge in the telecom industry. 

<h3>Exploratory Data Analysis</h3>
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is essential to unveil critical insights that directly inform strategies for customer retention and business decisions.The categorical features, including gender, senior citizenship, and service subscriptions, are scrutinized through bar charts. These visualizations reveal specific patterns, such as the higher likelihood of churn among younger customers without partners or dependents. Meanwhile, the analysis of services subscribed to, such as internet, streaming, and tech support, exposes trends influencing customer loyalty. Payment-related features, like contract length and billing methods, are crucial components of the analysis. The EDA illuminates that shorter contract terms and paperless billing correlate with higher churn rates. The analysis of payment methods provides insights for optimizing billing processes and minimizing customer attrition. 

<h3>Data Preprocessing</h3>
In the data preprocessing phase, we streamline the dataset for machine learning. We start by removing the customerID column and then convert categorical features into numerical values. Categorical features with more than two categories undergo one-hot encoding. We analyze the correlation between features to understand their relationships. Features like MultipleLines, OnlineSecurity, etc., which are highly correlated, are considered for potential removal. We then use a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) to assess the statistical significance of each feature. The p-values indicate which features significantly impact churn. Features like SeniorCitizen, Tenure, Contract, and PaperlessBilling stand out as statistically significant. For gauging feature importance, we examine the exponential coefficient values. These coefficients estimate how a one-unit change in a feature influences churn. Coefficients greater than 1 suggest an increased likelihood of churn, while those less than 1 indicate a lower likelihood. Finally, we normalize the range of all features through feature scaling. This ensures that each feature contributes proportionately to the machine learning models, preventing any single feature from dominating due to its scale.

<h3>Machine Learning Models</h3>
The algorithms employed in this project include Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, and Naive-Bayes Classifier. These models were trained and evaluated on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Among these models, Logistic Regression demonstrated the best performance across all metrics. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) was applied to identify the most relevant features, and the model was retrained with the optimized set of features. To further improve the Logistic Regression model, hyperparameter tuning was performed using Randomized Search. This process involved searching through different combinations of hyperparameters to identify the configuration that maximizes the model's performance.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
The objective of this project was to develop a predictive model for customer churn in the telecommunications sector. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, we explored various models such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, and Naive Bayes Classifier. Logistic Regression emerged as the most effective algorithm for the application. The analysis delved into identifying critical factors influencing customer churn, such as tenure, contract type, and paperless billing. Subsequently, the Logistic Regression model was refined through hyperparameter tuning, that helped to optimize its predictive accuracy. The culmination of this effort is a robust model capable of foreseeing customer churn, thereby empowering the telecom company to proactively manage customer retention strategies.
